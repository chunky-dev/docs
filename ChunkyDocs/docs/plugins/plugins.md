An AI denoiser using Intel Open Image Denoise. Very effective at reducing noise and can be used to effectively cut render times by orders of magnitude.

** Installation **

1. Download the release version of the denoiser `.jar` from the Github Repo for the version of Chunky you have.

      | Version        | Plugin Version | Plugin File                   |
      | -------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
      | Chunky 2.4+    | v0.4.0         | `chunky-denoiser.jar`         |
      | Chunky 2.0-2.3 | v0.3.2         | `chunky-denoiser-chunky2.jar` |
      | Chunky 1       | v0.3.2         | `chunky-denoiser-chunky1.jar` |

2. Download the [Precompiled Intel Open Image Denoise Binary Packages](https://www.openimagedenoise.org/downloads.html)
   for your OS. (ie for Windows it would be `oidn-1.4.1.x64.vc14.windows.zip`)
3. Extract the oidn `.zip` file to a chosen location. (ie `C:\Program Files\oidn-1.4.1.x64.vc14.windows\...`)
4. Add and enable the denoising plugin `.jar` in Chunky.
5. After launching Chunky, a new Denoiser tab will be found among the render controls. Expand this tab, next to the
   Denoiser there will be a button `...` clicking this will open a file selector. Navigate to the install location and
   then into bin and select `oidnDenoise.exe`. The full path to the Denoiser would be displayed in the text field.
   For this example it would be: `C:\Program Files\oidn-1.4.1.x64.vc14.windows\bin\oidnDenoise.exe`
6. Render normally! Profit! The Denoising Plugin with render the Normal and Albedo Map before the Noisy image.
   Once the Target SPP is reached the image will be denoised and saved into snapshots with the extension `*.denoised.*`.
   You can also find the original .pfm files in the scenes directory should you wish to use these for anything.

## Octree Plugin

[:material-account: aTom3333](https://github.com/aTom3333) &middot; [:material-github: GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aTom3333/chunky-octree-plugin) &middot; [:material-tag: Releases](https://github.com/aTom3333/chunky-octree-plugin/releases)

This is a plugin for Chunky that adds more octree implementations with a range of uses and benefits. See the GitHub
repository for more information and use. Notable implementations:

- Disk Implementation - Caches octree to disk. Extremely slow compared to other octree implementations but bypasses
  memory limits when loading large worlds.
- Garbage-collected Implementation - Generally faster octree creation / loading times. Higher peak memory usages.
- Dictionary Implementation - Lower memory usage than `PACKED`. Slightly slower while rendering and loading.
- Small DAG Implementation - Even lower memory usage than `DICTIONARY`. Slightly slower while rendering and loading.

A few more options are available but not listed.
