![Scene tab](../../img/user_interface/render_controls/scene_tab.png)

-`Open scene directory` - Opens current scenes directory on disk. It is `~/.chunky/scenes` by default.

- `Restore default settings` - Reset all scene settings to the default.

`Load selected chunks` - Load the chunks selected in the Map view into Chunky. Once clicked, this will load each chunk of the Minecraft world (which may take a while)! After this process completes, you may begin rendering.

`Reload chunks` - Re-load the currently selected chunks. If working with a loaded scene, ensure the the current selected world is the same as the world used to create the scene.

---

- `Canvas size` - This is the resolution at which to render at. The drop down has a few presets. (Width x Height)

- `Set default` - Sets current canvas size as default.

- `x0.5`, `x1.5`, `x2` - Modifies each axis of the canvas by the amount. ie Wx0.5, Hx0.5

- `Load players` - If this checkbox is checked, player models are loaded when loading a world. Should be noted that deselecting this option does not unload players that have already been loaded; these need to be manually removed via the Entities tab.

- `Enable biome colors` - This checkbox controls biome tinting of natural blocks like grass or leaves.

- `Save dump once every X` - This checkbox controls if Chunky will automatically save the scene and render periodically while rendering. This is not instant and does take time to save so it is recommended to not save too frequently.

- `Save snapshot for each dump` - This checkbox controls if Chunky will automatically generate a snapshot and
save it when the dump is saved when rendering.

- `Y min clip` - This controls the minimum loaded level inclusively. For example if it is set to 0, all blocks at and above `y=0` are loaded factoring `Y max clip`.

- `Y max clip` - This controls the maximum loaded level inclusively. For example if it is set to 255, all blocks at and below `y=255` are loaded factoring `Y min clip`.
